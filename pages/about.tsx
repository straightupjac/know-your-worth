              Have you ever received a job offer and struggled to figure out if it was actually one worth taking? If so, {`you're`} not alone.

            <Text>
              One of the biggest challenges of working in a relatively new industry like Web3 is figuring out how much you should be getting compensated for your work. Specific salaries and benefits for crypto companies are not something we can just easily Google (at least not yet!).
            </Text>
            <Text>
              We know there {`isn't`} enough reference data out there for compensation and benefits. We want to change that <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockchaingirls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Women in Blockchain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ValuesIndex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ValuesIndex</a> invite everyone in Web3 to share salary, comp, and other relevant information to help each other know our worth!

We looked at resources and job boards with general salary trends but we wanted an easier way to share and compare information.

              We are particularly interested in uncovering trends across gender, race/ethnicity, geography, and company size.

            <Text>
              Our goal is to collect 1,000+ responses across all roles and functions, with a variety of gender identities and backgrounds represented. We invite everyone to complete the survey in order to truly understand how compensation might vary between groups. No matter how you identify, we want to hear from you.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              This is a volunteer-run, grass-roots initiative. We plan to publish a report of our findings but all responses will live on a publicly visible spreadsheet.

            <Text>
              {`We're`} just getting started! We have big dreams for this project. Both Women in Blockchain and ValuesIndex believe that data is a public good, and {`it's`} only when we measure what matters that we can hope to improve it.
